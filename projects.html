                 In the not-so-distant future, the mysteries of space are calling. As captain of the elite crew aboard the Peregrination, your mission is to venture to the edge of the Sol system, where an eerie and powerful signal—the Logos Anomaly—has been detected. Your objective: uncover the secrets of this strange phenomenon, manage your crew, and survive the deadly challenges that await you in the deep reaches of space.

            <div class="story-content">  
               <p>The man lay flat in the snow, his rifle resting against the cold rock and ice that make up the cliff side; his eyes tracing lines between the red trees, watching the silhouettes walking in a staggered line, veiled with the furs of beasts. The falling snow blanketing the once soft fertile ground, gently gliding from the sky, the silhouettes become less distinct. He uses the contrast of the red woods to track his targets. The snow, white and pure, gentle, and sharp, he sees her in her matching dress, the light in her smile, the joy in her eyes. His sight fades for a moment. He clutches the ring tied to a string around his neck and refocuses himself. The sun beginning to set behind him, the blinding light and fresh snow will turn him into a ghost.</p>  
           
               <p>He glances at his watch.</p>  
           
               <p>He opens the small package, colorfully wrapped, revealing the small wrist worn timepiece inside. She smiles at him and giggles in that way that only she does. He smiles back at her and begins to tease her for that sweet sound. She gets embarrassed and blushes. The red of her cheeks matched by the trees of the woods. He feels the fine leather strap against his skin, the cold metal slowly growing more comfortable, the thoughtful gift she gave him. He feels warm, can't help but smile and stare. She blushes again while fidgeting with the ring on her finger, glancing up at him questioningly.</p>  
           
               <p>"What?"</p>  
           
               <p>The man snaps his mind back to attention. Time is a factor. The white snow begins to slowly bury him, but he ignores it. It only serves to his advantage with its concealment. He looks at the lightly covered sun and then back at his watch again. It's almost time now. The setting sun, so vibrant in color that the snow itself seems to bleed the orange hues; so bright that it almost loses all distinction.</p>  
           
               <p>The lights flash in the distance, turning the night sky to a sunless dawn. The alarms blare all around them. He takes her hand and begins running as the entire horizon bleeds orange and red and the stars seem to slowly fade out of existence. They run to their already prepped shelter, hoping to escape. He ushers her in and slams the thick metal door behind them. They rush down into the darkness.</p>  
           
               <p>His vision tunnels as he aims at the first figure. Calculating the distance, he slowly squeezes the trigger. The first shot is fired. The crack of the ignition echoes through the valley. The first target falls silently as the rest begin to panic, darting in every direction. The terrain works to confuse them. The next shot is fired. The rifle's suppressor prevents any sign of the muzzle flash. The sound continues to ring out through the landscape as the next target falls.</p>  
           
               <p>The falling snow drifts down to the cracked and pitted roads. The decay of buildings now held together using salvage and tarps. Refugees brought out of their torn and tattered shelters. Broken families and broken homes. The man clutches her hand and holds her close; following the instructions as dictated over the static of worn loudspeakers.</p>  
           
               <p>"They're lining us up now," he notes, as they're separated into groups. She looks up at him now, worry plastering her pale face. He spots the figures with their weapons in the distance. The sky hasn't been visible in months. Only the blistering orb's light piercing through the dense cloud cover. The snow rarely stopped after that. They ran out of food weeks ago, supplies mostly scavenged out of existence. The two of them knew this was coming; everyone felt the anxiety in the air, the approaching hunger, the desperation. She signals to a break in their numbers, and he nods in agreement. They weave their way out just before the chaos begins. The screams still harrowing.</p>  
           
               <p>His prey start screaming, some out of pain and others in attempts to coordinate. They start darting between the massive red trees, trying to confuse their attacker while searching for his location. But they're only serving to make themselves easier targets for him. He fires again, another one falls, thrown back from the cover he was breaking for, his splattered red mingling with the sun and the trees. The rest fall silent, refusing to move from hiding. Fear keeps them frozen, much like their surroundings, dying men in a dying world.</p>  
           
               <p>He guarded her as she guided the few that they could gather through the underground. They made their home in abandoned tunnels where trains once traveled. Taking in the desperate, the hopeful, the abandoned, any who still had a hope for the future. They were making progress, building something new in the ashes of the old. Time would tell if their work had any real meaning.</p>  
           
               <p>Hours passed as the man watched the trees, tracking for the slightest movement. The sun had gone down, and the real cold would come soon. If his targets had any desire to live through the night they needed to get out of that valley, but he wasn't going to let them, and he had no intention of surviving. Desperation would push them past fear, and this was what he waited for. One of them made a mad dash for cover a few feet away, but the man cut him down long before it could be reached.</p>  
           
               <p>She believed that the two of them could reach a future, and so he fought for it. Really, he was fighting for her. They had spread so far so quickly that it seemed like there was a real chance for reclamation. They began to move back to the surface, as dangerous as it was, in hope of restoring a life in the light of the sun. The clouds had grown less dense over the years and while the sun still seared through the damaged ozone there was hope that new life could grow. But hunger and desperation should never be underestimated. They came for them, stealing their food, burning their homes, dragging them off in the night.</p>  
           
               <p>The scream stole him from his trance. The man watched as another in desperation tried to run, but the man had no more mercy in him. It was all spent, and they had already taken more than could be returned. The man took aim and fired. Another one fell, this time trying to drag himself to safety, still desperate for a life already spent. The man watched him, hands starting to shake.</p>  
           
               <p>The beasts took her from him. After everything that they had built, those who could not build came to take what they could, setting fire to what they could not. Those that survived tried to flee, but there was nowhere left to go. She tried to stop it. She wouldn't let them take what they wanted, and so they took her. He tried to stop it, but in the end all he could do was bury her.</p>  
           
               <p>The cold was beginning to take him, his body was numb, and his vision blurred. With his ammunition spent, the man clutched her ring in his fist once more, gripping his knife with the other. He watched and waited, searching for a sign; the hunt unfinished with one still standing, but it was now too dark and the cloud cover too dense for the moon to divulge. The sun had gone down and soon he would too. Was this enough? Would the cold take them both now? Would the snow bury him like he did her?</p>  
           
               <p>His eyelids grow heavy, and his head starts to nod.</p>  
           
               <p>She's warm, he grasps her hand, she embraces him. He keeps her close as they guide others through the tunnels, making sure that none are lost in the dark. She slips away from him, now he's in the dark, lost in tunnels and trees, the snow so deep that he feels like he's suffocating. He can't move. It's cold. He hears footsteps, trudging through the snow, following close behind…</p>

            <p>Up the hill, do you see it? Past the tree line. That's right… keep going. There you go, around the ancient evergreens and through the shade of old oak trees. Their amber leaves are falling gently, crackling under your feet, such a satisfying feeling, isn't it? Like stepping on a mound of bugs or crushing dead men's bones.</p>  
        
            <p>They say it's the perfect season to look for her you know, maybe the old stories are true after all? Of course, you've heard them all before, haven't you? Or have you forgotten? The stories your grandmother used to tell by your bedside.</p>  
        
            <p>Do you feel that breeze? It's so gentle, soft as your mother's touch. Softer still than the boiling pot of water she dropped on you. Why did she do that again? All you did was ask her about the stories your grandmother would tell. The same stories she told your mother before she went and died… at least, that's what your mother told you.</p>  
        
            <p>Look at you, traveling all this way by yourself, I'm so proud of you! The cloak your father made you is all worn now isn't it. It was the last thing he gave you before he left. They all looked at you like you were less a person and more a thing. By the end even your own mother couldn't stand to look at you. But your father never cared about all that; neither did your grandmother, she would still come to your bed side every night and tell you those stories about her in sweet half rhymes. Your father warned you that you shouldn't listen, but look at you.</p>

      <p>Oh good, your awake. I thought you might never open your eyes again. It's dark, can't see a thing. The birds are gone now. The only sound is that of chirping crickets. The sound of twigs, branches, leaves, all swaying and sizzling in the breeze. You're hungry, I know. I know your thoughts; I can feel you deep inside. You ache all over, you feel the heavy wet of moist ground, and something else. There's something warm pouring from you, little by little. Little by little. I'm sure those are going to leave scars, but you don't really care at this point, do you? Just add them to the pile at this point, right?</p>  
  
      <p class="dialogue">Where are you?</p>  
  
      <p>Oh, sounds like they're catching up to us. The thoughts are starting to echo in you now, aren't they? That erroneous repeating in ever fainter voices. Nothing vivacious about them. The hair on the back of your neck is starting to stiffen as the cold creeps run along your skin, tingling up your spine.</p>  
  
      <p class="dialogue">What are you doing?</p>  
  
      <p>That's what fear feels like, doesn't it? Your instincts are finally starting to kick in, causing you to jump right to your feet, good for you! <span class="effect">*snicker*</span></p>

      <p>Can you discern them? What are they talking about? Why are they laughing at you? Who am I kidding, of course they're laughing at you! What are you planning indeed, do you even know where you're going? Do you even know what you seek?</p>

      <p>Scrambling to the house you push open the door!</p>  
  
      <p>Then silence takes you at last, as your flaming vision and blazing heart grows dark and cold once more. The old woman, with her broad and pointed hat, rises from her rocking chair, and turns to face you. Her dark cloak obscuring her form.</p>  
  
      <p>With a sharp toothed grin and bright yellow eyes, she welcomes you in. And through the door you enter. Welcome home little one, never seen, nor heard from, again.</p>
