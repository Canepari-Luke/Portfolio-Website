                 In the not-so-distant future, the mysteries of space are calling. As captain of the elite crew aboard the Peregrination, your mission is to venture to the edge of the Sol system, where an eerie and powerful signal—the Logos Anomaly—has been detected. Your objective: uncover the secrets of this strange phenomenon, manage your crew, and survive the deadly challenges that await you in the deep reaches of space.

            <div class="story-content">  
               <p>The man lay flat in the snow, his rifle resting against the cold rock and ice that make up the cliff side; his eyes tracing lines between the red trees, watching the silhouettes walking in a staggered line, veiled with the furs of beasts. The falling snow blanketing the once soft fertile ground, gently gliding from the sky, the silhouettes become less distinct. He uses the contrast of the red woods to track his targets. The snow, white and pure, gentle, and sharp, he sees her in her matching dress, the light in her smile, the joy in her eyes. His sight fades for a moment. He clutches the ring tied to a string around his neck and refocuses himself. The sun beginning to set behind him, the blinding light and fresh snow will turn him into a ghost.</p>  
           
               <p>He glances at his watch.</p>  
           
               <p>He opens the small package, colorfully wrapped, revealing the small wrist worn timepiece inside. She smiles at him and giggles in that way that only she does. He smiles back at her and begins to tease her for that sweet sound. She gets embarrassed and blushes. The red of her cheeks matched by the trees of the woods. He feels the fine leather strap against his skin, the cold metal slowly growing more comfortable, the thoughtful gift she gave him. He feels warm, can't help but smile and stare. She blushes again while fidgeting with the ring on her finger, glancing up at him questioningly.</p>  
           
               <p>"What?"</p>  
           
               <p>The man snaps his mind back to attention. Time is a factor. The white snow begins to slowly bury him, but he ignores it. It only serves to his advantage with its concealment. He looks at the lightly covered sun and then back at his watch again. It's almost time now. The setting sun, so vibrant in color that the snow itself seems to bleed the orange hues; so bright that it almost loses all distinction.</p>  
           
               <p>The lights flash in the distance, turning the night sky to a sunless dawn. The alarms blare all around them. He takes her hand and begins running as the entire horizon bleeds orange and red and the stars seem to slowly fade out of existence. They run to their already prepped shelter, hoping to escape. He ushers her in and slams the thick metal door behind them. They rush down into the darkness.</p>  
           
               <p>His vision tunnels as he aims at the first figure. Calculating the distance, he slowly squeezes the trigger. The first shot is fired. The crack of the ignition echoes through the valley. The first target falls silently as the rest begin to panic, darting in every direction. The terrain works to confuse them. The next shot is fired. The rifle's suppressor prevents any sign of the muzzle flash. The sound continues to ring out through the landscape as the next target falls.</p>  
           
               <p>The falling snow drifts down to the cracked and pitted roads. The decay of buildings now held together using salvage and tarps. Refugees brought out of their torn and tattered shelters. Broken families and broken homes. The man clutches her hand and holds her close; following the instructions as dictated over the static of worn loudspeakers.</p>  
           
               <p>"They're lining us up now," he notes, as they're separated into groups. She looks up at him now, worry plastering her pale face. He spots the figures with their weapons in the distance. The sky hasn't been visible in months. Only the blistering orb's light piercing through the dense cloud cover. The snow rarely stopped after that. They ran out of food weeks ago, supplies mostly scavenged out of existence. The two of them knew this was coming; everyone felt the anxiety in the air, the approaching hunger, the desperation. She signals to a break in their numbers, and he nods in agreement. They weave their way out just before the chaos begins. The screams still harrowing.</p>  
           
               <p>His prey start screaming, some out of pain and others in attempts to coordinate. They start darting between the massive red trees, trying to confuse their attacker while searching for his location. But they're only serving to make themselves easier targets for him. He fires again, another one falls, thrown back from the cover he was breaking for, his splattered red mingling with the sun and the trees. The rest fall silent, refusing to move from hiding. Fear keeps them frozen, much like their surroundings, dying men in a dying world.</p>  
           
               <p>He guarded her as she guided the few that they could gather through the underground. They made their home in abandoned tunnels where trains once traveled. Taking in the desperate, the hopeful, the abandoned, any who still had a hope for the future. They were making progress, building something new in the ashes of the old. Time would tell if their work had any real meaning.</p>  
           
               <p>Hours passed as the man watched the trees, tracking for the slightest movement. The sun had gone down, and the real cold would come soon. If his targets had any desire to live through the night they needed to get out of that valley, but he wasn't going to let them, and he had no intention of surviving. Desperation would push them past fear, and this was what he waited for. One of them made a mad dash for cover a few feet away, but the man cut him down long before it could be reached.</p>  
           
               <p>She believed that the two of them could reach a future, and so he fought for it. Really, he was fighting for her. They had spread so far so quickly that it seemed like there was a real chance for reclamation. They began to move back to the surface, as dangerous as it was, in hope of restoring a life in the light of the sun. The clouds had grown less dense over the years and while the sun still seared through the damaged ozone there was hope that new life could grow. But hunger and desperation should never be underestimated. They came for them, stealing their food, burning their homes, dragging them off in the night.</p>  
           
               <p>The scream stole him from his trance. The man watched as another in desperation tried to run, but the man had no more mercy in him. It was all spent, and they had already taken more than could be returned. The man took aim and fired. Another one fell, this time trying to drag himself to safety, still desperate for a life already spent. The man watched him, hands starting to shake.</p>  
           
               <p>The beasts took her from him. After everything that they had built, those who could not build came to take what they could, setting fire to what they could not. Those that survived tried to flee, but there was nowhere left to go. She tried to stop it. She wouldn't let them take what they wanted, and so they took her. He tried to stop it, but in the end all he could do was bury her.</p>  
           
               <p>The cold was beginning to take him, his body was numb, and his vision blurred. With his ammunition spent, the man clutched her ring in his fist once more, gripping his knife with the other. He watched and waited, searching for a sign; the hunt unfinished with one still standing, but it was now too dark and the cloud cover too dense for the moon to divulge. The sun had gone down and soon he would too. Was this enough? Would the cold take them both now? Would the snow bury him like he did her?</p>  
           
               <p>His eyelids grow heavy, and his head starts to nod.</p>  
           
               <p>She's warm, he grasps her hand, she embraces him. He keeps her close as they guide others through the tunnels, making sure that none are lost in the dark. She slips away from him, now he's in the dark, lost in tunnels and trees, the snow so deep that he feels like he's suffocating. He can't move. It's cold. He hears footsteps, trudging through the snow, following close behind…</p>

You have to get to Yew Forest before nightfall, and up to her cottage before midnight. It's a dangerous place you're going to, you wouldn't want to get lost after dark.</p>  
        
            <p>Up the hill, do you see it? Past the tree line. That's right… keep going. There you go, around the ancient evergreens and through the shade of old oak trees. Their amber leaves are falling gently, crackling under your feet, such a satisfying feeling, isn't it? Like stepping on a mound of bugs or crushing dead men's bones.</p>  
        
            <p>They say it's the perfect season to look for her you know, maybe the old stories are true after all? Of course, you've heard them all before, haven't you? Or have you forgotten? The stories your grandmother used to tell by your bedside.</p>  
        
            <p>Do you feel that breeze? It's so gentle, soft as your mother's touch. Softer still than the boiling pot of water she dropped on you. Why did she do that again? All you did was ask her about the stories your grandmother would tell. The same stories she told your mother before she went and died… at least, that's what your mother told you.</p>  
        
            <p>Look at you, traveling all this way by yourself, I'm so proud of you! The cloak your father made you is all worn now isn't it. It was the last thing he gave you before he left. They all looked at you like you were less a person and more a thing. By the end even your own mother couldn't stand to look at you. But your father never cared about all that; neither did your grandmother, she would still come to your bed side every night and tell you those stories about her in sweet half rhymes. Your father warned you that you shouldn't listen, but look at you.</p>

      <p>Oh good, your awake. I thought you might never open your eyes again. It's dark, can't see a thing. The birds are gone now. The only sound is that of chirping crickets. The sound of twigs, branches, leaves, all swaying and sizzling in the breeze. You're hungry, I know. I know your thoughts; I can feel you deep inside. You ache all over, you feel the heavy wet of moist ground, and something else. There's something warm pouring from you, little by little. Little by little. I'm sure those are going to leave scars, but you don't really care at this point, do you? Just add them to the pile at this point, right?</p>  
  
      <p class="dialogue">Where are you?</p>  
  
      <p>Oh, sounds like they're catching up to us. The thoughts are starting to echo in you now, aren't they? That erroneous repeating in ever fainter voices. Nothing vivacious about them. The hair on the back of your neck is starting to stiffen as the cold creeps run along your skin, tingling up your spine.</p>  
  
      <p class="dialogue">What are you doing?</p>  
  
      <p>That's what fear feels like, doesn't it? Your instincts are finally starting to kick in, causing you to jump right to your feet, good for you! <span class="effect">*snicker*</span></p>

      <p>Can you discern them? What are they talking about? Why are they laughing at you? Who am I kidding, of course they're laughing at you! What are you planning indeed, do you even know where you're going? Do you even know what you seek?</p>

      <p>Scrambling to the house you push open the door!</p>  
  
      <p>Then silence takes you at last, as your flaming vision and blazing heart grows dark and cold once more. The old woman, with her broad and pointed hat, rises from her rocking chair, and turns to face you. Her dark cloak obscuring her form.</p>  
  
      <p>With a sharp toothed grin and bright yellow eyes, she welcomes you in. And through the door you enter. Welcome home little one, never seen, nor heard from, again.</p>

                 <p>The young man walked across plains of grass, his suit was designed to keep him protected from any potential radiation spikes, and the ghillie covering was designed to help keep him hidden. Most of the grass was dead, it crackled under his feet and left him missing the green pastures of his colony. There were occasional trees, streams, or otherwise green patches but most of it was weeds and dead grass as far as the eye could see.</p>  
               </div>  
           
               <div class="scene">  
                 <p>After days of walking, the large pack he wore filled with needed supplies for their sister colony started to feel all the heavier, but after making the trip multiple times he didn't let it slow him down.</p>  
                   
                 <p>As he came over a hill, he could spot the landmark showing that he was close to the end of his travels. The unaware could be forgiven in thinking they were looking at a large town or small city, but he knew better. It was a massive junk heap, one of the old ones from before the era of the wastes.</p>

                    <p class="narrative">He lifted his arm and pulled back the ghillie covering, revealing a complex set of buttons and a screen that controlled his suit and gave him status updates. Holding one of the buttons to communicate, he responded.</p>  
                     
                    <p class="character-dialogue">"Yeah, Joe, I'm here. What's up?"</p>

                    <p class="character-dialogue">"I'm already looking at that ugly junk heap. I'm too close, there are no other routes now."</p>  
                     
                    <p class="narrative">He took his finger off the button and waited for the response.</p>  
                     
                    <p class="radio-message">"Yeah, well… They were spotted not too far from there. Try to find some cover and I'll send a party to come and get you."</p>

                 <p>The radio fell silent again, and Micah begins walking towards his destination.</p>  
                   
                 <p>Micah knew it was a risk with the sorts of things that live in the junkyard wastes, but he chose to stay close anyway to make use of the tall grass that grew along the edge. Hopefully the raiders would be smart enough to keep their distance from that monster infested hellhole the local colony called a junkyard.</p>  
                   
                 <p>Keeping as quiet as he could and staying low to the ground as he walked, he knew he was dancing between a rock and a hard place, but so long as nothing came out of the junk to say hello and the raiders kept their distance, he should've been fine.</p>

                 <p>Micah's eyes were hidden behind the mask of his suit, but they were darting around in search of a good escape route. Looking towards the tall grass he was willing to bet himself that the other raiders were already waiting in there for him to make a dash for it.</p>  
                   
                 <div class="action-sequence">  
                    <p>The man pulled off his hood, revealing the cysts and cancers growing all over his ugly and scarred skin.</p>  
                     
                    <p class="raider-dialogue">"I bet anything you look pretty under that fancy helmet of yours. All you colonists with your fancy gear. Bet you anything you wouldn't stay pretty after a few weeks livin' like us!"</p>  
                     
                    <p>Micah knew he had to get out, if these guys caught him, he wasn't going to live a few weeks like them, at least not if they were feeling merciful enough to kill him.</p>

                 <p>Micah looked behind him just long enough to see a group of about ten raiders emerge from the tall grass and chase after him. The one that was behind him was the closest, carrying a massive lead pipe with a rock tied to one end.</p>

               <p>Micah didn't think about where he was going, where he would go after getting away. The first and only thing on his mind now was escaping these lunatics.</p>  
                 
               <p>As Micah rushed through the junkyard, he had to be careful about avoiding sharp and jagged scrap metal or rebar sticking out of the pillars of trash that surrounded him.</p>  
                 
               <p>Banking left and right, through and under scrap heaps, he tried everything he could to lose them.</p>

             <div class="scene weapon-check">  
               <p>He instinctively checked the weapon at his hip. A small one-handed firearm that contained batteries called cells in a cartridge. Due to the amount of cargo, he couldn't take many cells with him. Each cell possessed enough energy to knock out, maybe even fry, a person. But Micah only had the four loaded into his weapon and the four in the spare cartridge.</p>

                  <p class="inner-thought">"Fat chance," Micah thought to himself. After all, the place was built like a maze. And while Micah had a compass to keep a sense of direction, these guys were more likely to get lost.</p>

               <p>As Micah finished rounding the corner, he came across a location so littered with trash that the ground was no longer visible. Climbing up the trash heap, he started to cross it. He hoped that once he reached the other side he could get around behind the group and continue on his journey from there.</p>  
                 
               <p>As Micah crossed the trash heap, he worked to avoid shattered glass or sharp metal, seeing what looked like a seesaw, Micah jumped on top in hopes of getting better footing.</p>  
                 
               <div class="tension-moment">  
                  <p>Suddenly, the counterweight seemed to move in an unnatural way, and two large pieces of plie wood with shards of glass and twisted metal came launching out of the ground.</p>  
                   
                  <p>Micah slammed his eyes shut, but nothing happened. Opening his eyes, he realized that whoever had set this trap had done so a long time ago. It was rusted and on the verge of falling apart, as well as getting caught on multiple large pieces of garbage. Micah breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

               <p>Looking past the lizard, he saw a broken-down jeep submerged in a massive pile of other scraps. If he could just get to it, he might be able to burrow in deep enough that the thing couldn't reach him.</p>  
                 
               <div class="action-sequence">  
                  <p>Micah leapt backwards past the trap he was standing on. All at once, the massive creature emerged from the trash and released a guttural shriek as it lunged after him.</p>

                  <p>The trap snapped shut on the monster, and it released an eerie humanish shriek. Micah ran around the thing as it shattered the trap with its other massive hand.</p>

               <p>He dove for the inside of the jeep and started scrambling in, but not fast enough. With one snap of its massive jaws the creature ripped Micah's leg clean off.</p>  
                 
               <div class="horror-sequence">  
                  <p>Micah spun around, unable to stop himself from screaming. After the monster lizard gulped down the leg it began mimicking his scream.</p>  
                   
                  <p>Tears fell from Micah's eyes as he pulled his weapon from its holster and prepared to fire. When suddenly the sound of a snap from a nearby place caught the creature's attention.</p>

                  <p>The creature lunged at the group of raiders fearlessly. Dave took the moment to scramble deeper into the car. Pulling a first aid kit out of his bag, he made a tourniquet and tied it around his leg.</p>  
                   
                  <p>He could only catch glimpses of it through small openings in the heap, but he could hear everything.</p>

               <p>Some of the raiders managed to run away. And fortunately for Micah, the thing chased after them.</p>

                  <p>Digging himself deeper into the heap, he pulled out a small cylindrical device and pressed a button, suddenly the top and bottom popped open and ballooned up.

A mix of painkillers to keep him conscious, and radiation treatment to stop the opening in his suit from killing him or poisoning him.</p>  
                   
                  <p>The drugs wouldn't last forever, Micah would have to act quickly.</p>

               <p>Taking out the first aid kit, Micah pulled out a gel like substance that he placed over the stump of his leg. The creature had bitten past the knee and partially up the thigh. Micah was lucky that he only lost the one leg.</p>  
                 
               <p>When he finished placing the gel, he attached a wire from it to the device on his wrist. Taking a deep breath and shutting his eyes tight, he pressed a button.</p>

                  <p>The gel quickly super-heated, searing the wound of his leg closed, as well as burning away any loose strands of flesh. Finally, the gel stuck to his damaged suit and created a radiation resistant seal.</p>  
                   
                  <p>Micah did his best not to scream out in pain, and then blacked out.</p>

               <p>When Micah awoke, it was dark. He was well hidden inside the heap of trash, but the fool moon and clear sky kept the area outside illuminated to the point that he didn't dare leave.</p>  
                 
               <p>The small flashing yellow light on the flouting beacon could just barely be seen through openings in the trash.</p>

               <p>Then his fears warmed him as he felt the heap rustling. Looking up, he saw a large shadow pass directly over him, and suddenly leap from above the heap into the center of the pile below.</p>  
                 
               <p>The thing landed no more than forty or fifty feet in front of the jeep he was nestled in.</p>

                  <p>Its eyes glinted a pale yellow in the light.</p>

                  <p>Tears started to run down Micah's face as he took in a sharp gasp of air.</p>

                  <p>It hit the creature square on the nose and stuck to it. The creature began convulsing but quickly swiped it away and rushed at Micah, its screams a mix of its victims as a deep guttural shriek of a dozen souls rang out!</p>  
                   
                  <p>Micah began sobbing as he fired again and again. Each time it slowed the creature for only a moment.</p>

                  <p>Micah pointed the weapon at his own head. Hoping that this final shot might do him some good at least.</p>

               <p>Micah watched in disbelief as another large arc of electricity landed on the creature. The charge was so powerful that they began flying in every direction like lightning had struck the thing.</p>
